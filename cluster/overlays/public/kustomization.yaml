# BijouxLabs Public Overlay - Default/placeholder variables
#
# This overlay serves as a reference template for public deployments.
# The kustomizevars.yaml file contains placeholder values that should be
# customized for your specific environment.
#
# To use these variables in your manifests, reference them as: $(VARIABLE_NAME)
#
# When deploying with Flux, the ConfigMap will be created from kustomizevars.yaml
# and variable substitution will occur automatically.
#
# See cluster/overlays/README.md for detailed usage instructions.

# This is a placeholder kustomization file
# In practice, you would use this with Flux CD or similar GitOps tools
# that can handle variable substitution and ConfigMap creation
